# US-Gun-Violence-Data-Visualisation
The following visualisation was created using D3.js and Topojson to visualise 
the problem of Gun Violence in theUnited States of America. 
This data used is a subset of the csv file downloaded from the Kaggle.

OS X
Instruction to Run this code:

>Installing Node.js live-server

>Verify that Node.js is installed. 
If you see anything when you run "which npm" in a terminal, it is. 
If not, follow the instructions at nodejs.org to install:

  >Install live-server: npm install -g live-server
  >Move your terminal to where your pages live: cd <path-to-content>
  >Start the server: live-server .
  >Open localhost:8080 in a browser.
  
The NodeJS live-server package runs a temporary server displaying any HTML/CSS/JS resources in the current folder. 
It automatically reloads the page in your browser when any of these files change.


> The instructs mentioned under the “OS X” section should be the same for Windows and Linux too
(Use “sudo” in linux or OS X if you have access errors)

> Download all the files in the folder and open the Command Line, from there enter
the path of the folder and then run the command “live-server .” .

> This should automatically open the browser for you with the visualisation.
